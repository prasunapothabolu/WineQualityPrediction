**Wine Quality Prediction ML model in Spark over AWS (EMR, EC2)**


A parallel Machine Learning application in Amazon AWS cloud platform built to predict the quality of Wine using Apache Spark, python.
The Modeling data application is designed to run on EMR with 4 instances.
Prediction application will run on EC2 single instance (with Docker and without Docker).

The Training Data was modelled using multiple classifiers to find classifier that give better performance.
Logistic regression, GBT regressor, Random forest classifier, Decision Tress classifier are used.
Decision Tree classifier give better performance. The metrics used to estimate performance are Run time,F1 score and Accuracy score.
